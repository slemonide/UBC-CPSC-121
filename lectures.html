<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>CPSC 121 promotes  an &quot;interactive engagement&quot;
lecture approach to facilitate your learning.
For this approach to work best, you should prepare before the
lecture as best suits your learning style, possibly by reading
the appropriate sections of the  text or working through sample
problems.  During class, the instructor will review some of the more
difficult concepts or examples from the readings, and lead you
through discussions and exercises.
After class, you will want to review the text and any
notes you took.</p>

<p>It also is <em>essential</em> that you ask questions
whenever there is a concept that you don't understand.</p>

<p>If you miss a lecture, catch up on what you missed
from a classmate and in office hours. If you are out of class
for an extended period of time, contact your instructor as soon
as possible to determine how to catch up. It is your responsibility
to be aware of any announcements that may have been made in your
absence.</p>

<h3>Textbook and iClicker</h3>

<p>The textbook for the course will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Epp, Susanna. <i>Discrete Mathematics with  Applications</i>,
  4th edition, Nelson Education, 2011, ISBN 0-495-39132-8
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 4th edition is our &quot;authoritative&quot; edition
(and should be available at the bookstore).
However, we include roughly comparable
page numbers for many other texts <a href="#readings">below</a>.</p>

<p>While purchasing the textbook is optional, you <em>will</em>
require an
<a target="_blank"
href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:Clickers/iClicker_FAQ_for_students">iClicker</a>
device to earn participation grades during lectures.</p>

<h3>Lecture Notes</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="slides/vogt/CPSC-121-911.pdf">Running
notes</a> containing some of the highlights of each lecture are
available.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="slides/vogt/Mux-Glitch.ppt">Slides about
the Mux glitch</a>, verbatim taken from Dr. Steve Wolfman, and based
on slides from Dr. Patrice Belleville.</p>

<h3>Lecture Schedule</h3>

<p>Lecture time during the semester is divided into 36 lecture
&quot;slots&quot;, plus two slots for the midterms. Given the
condensed nature of the summer term, that equates to roughly
two and a half lecture slots per day that we are together.</p>

<p>What follows is a tentative breakdown of the topics that will
be covered in each lecture slot.</p>

<a name="readings" /><h3>Readings</h3>

<p>While Epp 4ed is the official textbook for CPSC 121, we have
included here equivalent section and page numbers for both the
earlier edition of Epp, as well as for earlier editions of Rosen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rosen, Kenneth H. <i>Discrete  Mathematics  and  its
  Applications</i>, 7th edition, McGraw Hill Book Company, 2012,
  ISBN 0-07-338309-0.</li>
  <li>Rosen, Kenneth H. and Grossman, Jerrold.
  <i>Student Solutions Guide for Discrete Mathematics and its
  Applications</i>,  7th edition, McGraw  Hill Book Company, 2012,
  ISBN 0-07-735350-1.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not have the equivalent section and page numbers for
Rosen 7ed, but we suspect that they are similar to those for
Rosen 6ed.</p>

<p>The topics in the following table are listed in the order in which
they are presented in Epp 4ed, not necessarily in the order in which
they will be covered in lecture.</p>

<h3>Recorded Lectures</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wolf/">Dr. Steve Wolfman</a>
has made available
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dmp110/CPSC121-203-2010W/">archived
recorded lectures</a> from the January-April 2011 term.</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>These are <em>only accessible</em> from ubcsecure wireless or a
  <a href="http://www.it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/myvpn">UBC

  </li>
  <li>They're labeled only by date; so, you'll have to estimate how
  far in to go and check what the slides have to say
  </li>
  <li>These are old videos; the course may have shifted since
  they were made in ordering, structure, and material;
  however, there is usually very high overlap
